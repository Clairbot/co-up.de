  Sponsor co.up

<p>
  Interested in becoming one of co.up’s supporting companies?
</p>

<h3>Why your support matters</h3>

<p>
  co.up is a community event space—but it’s so much more than that. It’s a place where the next generation of developers, designers, innovators and entrepreneurs are honing their craft right now; it’s a place where your financial background doesn’t determine the level of support you receive; and it’s part of the spirit of the Berlin tech scene.
</p>

<p>
  For 10 years, co.up has provided free tech education to thousands of attendees across thousands of meetups, workshops, and learning groups. co.up kicked off the creative tech scene in Berlin when there was no infrastructure to train tech talent, no places to meet and collaborate, no places that were open and inclusive. It is safe to say that co.up has shaped a big part of the current technical work force in Berlin, and spawned many huge and influential communities in Berlin, e.g. the CSSconf and JSconf events, the OpenTechSchool movement, and more.
</p>

<p>
  Find a complete list of the events that take place in the space here: <a href="/events">https://co-up.de/events/</a>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Now you have the chance to be a part of co.up’s next chapter by becoming a co.up sponsor.</b>Your contribution will directly help provide an affordable space to organizations fighting to make tech more representative.
</p>

<p>
  We need to raise 3000€ in monthly contributions in order to maintain co.up and our mission. Your company contribution will make an enormous difference in whether co.up can stay affordable and open to the community for events, learning groups, workshops, and more.
</p>

<h3>How can you sponsor co.up?</h3>

<p>
  You help us most by committing to a recurring monthly contribution of at least <a href="https://members.co-up.de/">EUR 200</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, you can make a 1-time contribution of at least <a href="https://members.co-up.de/">EUR 500</a>.
</p>

<h3>What we offer</h3>
<p>
  We estimate that between 20-50.000 people have come through co.up over the years, over an estimated 3000 events, and every month we currently get around 500 visitors. This is an opportunity for you to not only support the organizations in the space, but make yourself visible to the countless future talent that is currently developing their skills in our space.
</p>

<p>
  <i>*These numbers are conservative best guesses, based on our calendar of the last ten years, and average visitor numbers that meetups report to us. We don’t track the exact number of visitors in the space.</i>
</p>

<p>
  All of our company supporters get the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your name, logo and link displayed on our website.</li>
  <li>A notice of thanks in the space itself, including your company name and logo.</li>
  <li>One thank-you tweet and one Facebook post.</li>
  <li>A mention in our blog.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you commit to a recurring membership of more than EUR 300, or contribute more than EUR 1500 at once, in addition to the benefits listed above, you’ll get the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 25% discount on renting the space for private company events (with a further discount on recurring events).</li>
  <li>A monthly thank-you tweet and Facebook post.</li>
  <li>A dedicated blog post about your company, e.g. your hiring goals or community work in Berlin (text provided by you).</li>
  <li>Opportunities for recruitment benefits (we do not allow recruiters into the space regularly, but we are working on ways to connect interested applicants with our company supporters.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We’re looking into more ways to thank our supporting companies. If your organization has a request, e.g. ideas about how co.up can support you in hiring, recruiting, or your education needs, please reach out to us and we can discuss ways that we can work together.
</p>

<h3>What we can’t offer</h3>

<p>
  Please note: co.up will not collect and provide our attendees or organizers’ personal data, nor will we demand from our communities to follow any marketing obligations. All events at co.up are run under a <a href="https://co-up.de/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> and must be free, open, and with a visible effort to be safe, inclusive and welcoming.
</p>
