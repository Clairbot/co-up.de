  Sponsor co.up
  <span>Make your company a supporter of Berlin’s tech community</span>

  Interested in becoming one of co.up’s supporting companies?
</p>

<h3>Why your support matters</h3>

<p>
  co.up is a community event space—but it’s so much more than that. It’s a place where the next generation of developers, designers, innovators and entrepreneurs are honing their craft right now; it’s a place where your financial background doesn’t determine the level of support you receive; and it’s part of the spirit of the Berlin tech scene. For 10 years, co.up has provided free tech education to thousands of attendees across thousands of meetups, workshops, and learning groups. co.up kicked off the creative tech scene in Berlin when there was no infrastructure to train tech talent, no places to meet and collaborate, no places that were open and inclusive. It is safe to say that co.up has shaped a big part of the current technical work force in Berlin, and spawned many huge and influential communities in Berlin, e.g. the CSSconf and JSconf events, the OpenTechSchool movement, and more.
</p>

<p>
  Now you have the chance to be a part of co.up’s next chapter, providing an affordable space to organizations fighting to make tech more representative.
</p>

<p>
  We need to raise 3000€ in monthly contributions in order to maintain co.up and our mission. Your company contribution will make an enormous difference in whether co.up can stay affordable and open to the community for events, learning groups, workshops, and more.
</p>
