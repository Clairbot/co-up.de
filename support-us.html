<p>
  We’ve been informed that the rent for co.up will be more than doubling in 2020 – and we need your help.

<p>
  In order for us to continue offering our space to the community, we need more people to help us financially offset the cost of running co.up. Our goal has always been to help support better representation in tech, and that means that we always offer our space as affordably as possible. Now we need your support in order to ensure that others will be able to access these same resources going into the future.

  Here’s how you can help:
