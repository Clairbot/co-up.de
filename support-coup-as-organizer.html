  Support co.up as a meetup organizer

<p>
  You probably know that we use the community space at co.up for our events, and we’ve got some important news about the space. Their rent will be doubling in 2020 and without immediate financial help they’ll be forced to close their doors. It won’t just affect us: co.up provides free event space for dozens of community organizations and without a major shift in support they will have to close their doors for good in January 2020. We don’t want this to happen!

  Here are a few ways you can help #saveCoUp:

    <strong>Inform your community and donate:</strong>
    Let your attendees know what they space is that they are using, and that it needs help to survive. Let them know how they can donate: In the tip jar in the space, via Paypal, via Ko-Fi, or ideally: as a monthly membership supporter! Recurring support is vital for our ability to keep co.up open.
