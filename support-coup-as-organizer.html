  Support co.up as a meetup organizer
</h1>

<p>
  You probably know that we use the community space at co.up for our events, and we’ve got some important news about the space. Their rent will be doubling in 2020 and without immediate financial help they’ll be forced to close their doors. It won’t just affect us: co.up provides free event space for dozens of community organizations and without a major shift in support they will have to close their doors for good in January 2020. We don’t want this to happen!

  Here are a few ways you can help #saveCoUp:
</p>

<ul class="support-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Join our Slack channel:</strong>
    Everyone using co.up, running meetups, and interested in helping with the #saveCoUp campaign is asked to join the co.up Slack channel, where we team up and share resources. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@co-up.de">hello@co-up.de</a> if you need an invite.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Discuss during your meetups:</strong>
    Let your attendees know that they are using the co.up community space, that they are warmly welcome, and that in return, they should treat it with respect, pay for drinks if they take any, and are invited to offer any additional help to #saveCoUp!
    Here are looped info slides for you that have all that information:

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tell your attendees how they can donate:</strong> Donations can be made in the tip jar in the space, via Paypal, via Ko-Fi, or as a monthly membership supporter! Recurring support is vital for our ability to keep co.up open.

  <li>
    <strong>Send a message or email to your community:</strong>
    Here is a <a href="/save-coup-text-for-organizers-mailing-lists">text suggestion</a> that you can copy and adapt.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Spread the word on your social media channels:</strong>
    Help co.up by raising awareness for the situation. This is the key web page you can link to: <a href="https://co-up.de/support-us/">co-up.de/support-us</a>. Nothing is as powerful as your personal stories – please tell the world why co.up matters to your community!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Find meetup sponsors to help co.up:</strong>
    Some meetups have found creative ways to allow sponsors at their meetups, and direct the income to co.up, while ensuring that the independence of the meetup is not impacted. For example, upfront.ug offers 1 minute announcement slots for a fixed price. This <a href="http://up.front.ug/sponsoring/">sponsor offer template</a> is free for every meetup to copy and adapt!
  </li>
</ul>
