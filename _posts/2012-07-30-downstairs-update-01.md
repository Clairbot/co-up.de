We’ve been hard at work on the new downstairs space, getting the basics covered in order to get it ready for various workshops, user groups, & of course our coworkers. With the big new room, we’ve been very happy & lucky to host [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Council/ReMo_Camp_2012), [RailsBridge in Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.tumblr.com/workshops/rails-bridge-supported-by-rails-girls-berlin-july-2012), the first [OpenTechSchool workshop](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2012/07/javascript-for-absolute-beginners-july.html), [Hacks/Hackers](http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/), & the [iOSDevBerlinUG](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=de&fromgroups#!forum/iosdevberlin), all in a span of just three weeks!

The tables our designer, [Thomas](http://raumfreude.de/), built for us are great; easily folded up & out of the way for our UG evenings. [Jan L.](https://twitter.com/#!/janl) came up with the plan for an audio system that would be easy to plug into, providing a better venue for our [user groups](bit.ly/CoUpCalendar), & helped [Alex](https://twitter.com/#!/langalex) install it. We currently have speakers & a microphone, & are looking into ways to record the talks at UGs easily in order to make them available to those who couldn’t attend in person.
We are currently in the process of choosing lighting that will create the best atmosphere for getting work done, without treading into cubicle farm territory, as well as considering the need for echo reduction so that whispers on one side of the room can’t be heard on the other. User group organizers have been contacted to find out what else we can do to provide the best space we can for them. Again, without all of your [help](http://co-up.de/2012/07/13/crowdfunding-thanks.html) we never could have done it. We’re very grateful!

It’s wonderful to be able to provide so much more space, & the recent flood of interest for new user groups has proven that this step was the right one for the enrichment of our community. If you have a non-profit, open user group or meetup that you’d like to organize, please have a look at the [events calendar](bit.ly/CoUpCalendar) to see which dates are free & get in touch via email (aleks \[at\] co-up.de) to get the ball rolling. Keep an eye on th fblog, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/co_up), & [FB page](http://www.facebook.com/co.up.cowoking) for more progress updates.
