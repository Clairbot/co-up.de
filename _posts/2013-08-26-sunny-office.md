We just started a collaboration with [Sunny Office](http://sunny-office.com) that offers our coworkers a 5% discount on their offers.

Sunny Office organize coworking retreats in sunny places in order to escape the cold northern European winter. From their website:

> Work & live with like-minded co-workers in beautiful places!

> Do you work location-independent?

> Would you like to escape winter, meet like-minded people and be in beautiful places?

> Sunny Office was born because I wanted to combine my love for sunny places and co-working. Work and live together with amazing like-minded people for one to two weeks.

> We provide beautiful villas with perfect infrastructure and take care of all the organization.

> Come over, bring your projects to the next level and have fun! You will be amazed how much focus, inspiration, great exchange and wonderful experiences you will find.

The 5% discount code is "CoUplovessun".
