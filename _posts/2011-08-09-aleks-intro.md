Hi! My name is Aleks; half-Latvian, half-USian, and now -- since not so long ago -- happy Berliner. Working at co.up is my first foray into the world of coworking and I'm enjoying it so far. I help Alex and Thilo to take care of the space, show new co-workers around, organize events like the [coworking hack day](http://coworkinghackday.org), and generally try to rein in chaos. ;) It's great to have the opportunity to learn so many new things, as well as work in a cool environment with nice, creative people.

Even though I'm surrounded by them on a daily basis at co.up and at home, I'm not actually a computer geek, but rather more of a literature/philosophy nerd (inter alia), with a keen interest in animal rights, feminism, queer theory and further deteriorating my already poor eyesight by reading all the books I can get my nose into. In my free time I like to bicycle around the city, attend geeky/nerdy/arty/political events and talk nonsense in German, which I am still in the process of learning. "Wenn du mit mir Deutsch sprichst, dann bitte langsam and deutlich! Danke!"

I'm also helping my friend, Swantje, open her own co-sewing space, so if you are interested in sewing, knitting or crafting at any skill level, visit the [Nadelwald](http://nadelwald.me/).

Any requests, tricks, suggestions and questions regarding co.up as well as explanations about German grammar and its "Ausnahmen" can be sent to aleks@co-up.de. If you want to stay updated about what we're doing at co.up, follow [@co_up](http://twitter.com/co_up) or [@piile](http://twitter.com/piile) if you'd like to follow my personal ramblings.
