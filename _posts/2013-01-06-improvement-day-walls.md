This month’s improvement day we spent on the 3rd floor drawing silhouettes of co.up's coworkers on the walls. The inspiration came from [this video of a party](http://vimeo.com/55661987) at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org/), where you can see numerous drawings on their walls.
We first thought about hiring some artist to do a bunch of drawings for us, but realized that we didn't really know what we wanted to draw and that it probably wouldn't have any connection to the space and its people. A few drinks later the idea to give the walls to our members was born.

As you might be able to see from the picture we used a flashlight to cast a shadow onto the wall and then traced the shape with markers. It’s so simple even I could do it, yet the results look surprisingly good.

As Luzi wouldn’t want to stand still for the minute it would have required to trace her we just took a picture and projected that onto the wall with a projector. Worked like a charm.

Thank you for all the coworkers who already participated in this project. We are hoping to get a lot more of you onto our walls. Feel free to add yourself, but please ask the team before as certain spots have to remain white (e.g. for the projector).

P.S. We have a [Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/co-up/) now. Yay!
