In case you didnâ€™t hear about it, we had a [very successful fundraiser](http://co-up.de/2012/01/10/fridge-thanks.html) for a gigantic new refrigerator. We would like to celebrate its arrival by testing out its ability to cool beers (& non-alcoholic beverages, to any teetotallers out there) for a large number of people. Anyone who contributed is invited to bring something to liven up the boring, white side of the refrigerator - postcards, pictures, comics, anything! Magnets will be provided. :)

Please [join us this Friday, February 3rd at 20:00](http://www.facebook.com/events/360385397305109/), & pass on the invitation!
