This Wednesday (02.11.2011) we celebrated the 2-year anniversary of co.up and -- a little late -- 5 years of [upstre.am](http://upstre.am). It really was a great party for me because so many people showed up who are somehow connected to us. I hadn't seen some of them since our last party a year ago (note to self, we should have more parties). And since coworking is not about a space but rather the people, I’d like to give a shout out to everybody that showed up (and who I can remember right now):

Our #1 coworker and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) expert [Jan](http://twitter.com/janl); former coworker and party friend [Tadas](http://twitter/tadassce); our wonderful accountant [Manuela](https://www.xing.com/profile/Manuela_Ikert); our latest coworker from Finland, [Jeremias](http://twitter.com/kangasbros) and his girlfriend Mare; [Christian](http://hanschristianf.de/) and [Georg](http://www.rexdesign.de/), two designers who helped us a lot with our first web apps and the upstre.am logo; [Julia Sörgel](https://plus.google.com/107220493752426142467/posts), whose time tracking app [mite](http://mite.yo.lk/) we use every day; [Pearl](http://twitter.com/#!/ProfessorPerl) from Austin, researching and living in Berlin right now and joining our party; Futurist and Blogger [Plomlompom](http://twitter.com/plomlompom); [Thomas](http://twitter.com/TMetschke), the maker of [scalarium](http://scalarium.com), a cloud management software that makes our life so much easier; short-time employee, long-time friend [Katrin](http://twitter.com/#!/_die_katrin); [Till](http://twitter.com/#!/klimpong), our favorite coworker with a [cute dog](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Luzi/173293279396?ref=ts); [Gilbert](http://twitter.com/gttmnn), our coworker and recent UI designer of choice, with his lovely girlfriend Anna; recent trial member and [author](http://kathrinpassig.kulturindustrie.com/buecher.html), [Katrin](http://twitter.com/#!/kathrinpassig); [Nico](http://hagenburger.net): designer, developer, fashion victim ;-) ; [knitting hacker](http://fabienne.us/2011/09/18/algorithmically-morphing-scarf/) [Fabienne](http://twitter.com/fbz); another former coworker [Alexis](http://twitter.com/surryhill), who’s now making awesome iPhone apps with [CodeKollektiv](http://www.codekollektiv.com/); [Alex](http://twitter.com/alexknowshtml), founder of indyhall and [coworking guru](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/category/coworking/); [Niklas](http://twitter.com/#!/umamipanda), a regular guest at our events ever since he found his passion for sewing during [coworkinghackday](http://coworkinghackday.org/); [Bernd](http://twitter.com/#!/BeeJay71) who just turned 38 years older than co.up that day; [Sebastian](http://twitter.com/#!/sippndipp) and his colleagues from [9elements.com](http://nine2011.9elements.com/), who rock Ruby on Rails in the Ruhrgebiet; [Rudolfs](http://twitter.com/#!/rudolfs) who did most of the work when [hacking our door opener](http://coworkinghackday.wikispaces.com/WebEnabledDoorOpener) so that we don't have to get up all the time to open the downstairs door; our community manager [Aleks](http://twitter.com/piile), who did a great job of organizing the party; [Gregor](http://twitter.com/#!/gr2m), also a former coworker who now works in Zurich mostly on his beautiful meeting tool [minutes.io](http://minutes.io); [Anne](http://twitter.com/#!/marthadear) who is fighting against discrimination and sexism with the [SlutWalk Berlin](http://slutwalkberlin.de/), as well as at least a dozen more people that I can't recall right now (sorry!).
