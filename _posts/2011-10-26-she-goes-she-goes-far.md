When you run a coworking space, new people pop in and out of your life (sometimes on a daily basis), and some people leave bigger impressions than others. Yet certain individuals shape things in a big way, and if such people move out of your space, it’s definitely something noteworthy. [Kristina](http://twitter.com/kriesse), our #3 coworker, is such a person. Today our friend is boarding her plane to San Francisco to start her new job as an Art Director for [Readyforzero](http://readyforzero.com), yeah! I thought I’d write down some parting words to say thank you.

When Kristina joined our coworking space, we didn’t even have a name, or even actually know that what we were doing is called coworking. We were impressed with her design skills and worked with her on many client projects. When we moved to the office that is now co.up, it was only natural for us to ask Kristina if she would create the logo and design for co.up (the one you see now). Well, it didn't end with that: she designed our [company website](http://upstre.am) and probably every of our project websites ever since, including our [Cobot Coworking App](https://cobot.me) with the cute Cobot character, so she became our face on the web. Thank you for that.

Besides being our designer of choice, she is a friend with whom we’ve shared some great experiences, from adventures like our [work abroad in Istanbul](http://vimeo.com/18005238) in 2010 (which I sadly had to pass on), to cool conferences like SXSW 2011, as well as many co.beers and a few long nights ending at her famous kitchen table, which was where the most quality time was spent. ;) Thanks for these great times.

And last, but not least, she influenced not only the life of our space but the entire web community in Berlin with her initiative for the [up.front](http://up.front.ug) user group, Berlin's biggest and only regular meeting for web designers and front-end developers. The meetup regularly brings the space to the verge of bursting. Well done! I guess she will have an eye on it from afar while [Hannes](http://twitter.com/kunstreich), [Jens](http://twitter.com/jensnikolaus), and [Robin](http://twitter.com/rmehner) keep it going. Thank you for making this happen.

This is just a short summary of how Kristina affected my life and the lives of others at co.up. It was great having you here with us, but since good things can't stay the same, only change, we'll make something good of it. We will follow your adventures in San Francisco closely and are sure that you will rock things hard over there!

And now a last personal thank you for giving me a sense for a good design and the right fonts.

You will be missed.
