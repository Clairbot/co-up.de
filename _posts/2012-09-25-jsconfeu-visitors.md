For JSConf attendees who need a place to work, hack, or just want to hang out & meet people, co.up will be open & waiting for you Mon/Tue & Thu/Fri, starting at 10:00! Since Wednesday is a public holiday, the space will be open only from 11:00 until 17:00. Please [come up to the top floor](co-up.de/about#location) & introduce yourself so we can help get you set up. We will also be hosting a [Sauce testing workshop](http://saucejs.eventbrite.com/) the next day, from 11:00 'til 15:00. See you then!
