With your [donations](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/17383/) we hope to expand co.up to a whole new level.

Thanks to our wonderful community, giant user groups, & many past, current, & future coworkers, co.up is buzzing with energy. For a while now we have been thinking about how we could improve the co.up experience for everyone & were lucky enough to spot an offer for the space on the third floor of our very building when it popped up a few weeks ago. Of course we jumped on it, thinking this would not only be a great way to accommodate more of the people who write to us looking to become coworkers, but also provide more room for the bigger user groups like [BerlinJS](http://berlinjs.org/) & [up.front](http://up.front.ug/), which regularly draw a hundred or more participants, as well as create more possibilities for the development of smaller ones, like [RailsGirls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.tumblr.com/) & the beginners’ workshops for other programming languages we hope to organize as a part of [OpenTechSchool](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentechschool). Having double the space would mean that we could double our efforts to support non-profit organizations & events for worthwhile causes we believe in, like the [Berlin Slutwalk](http://slutwalkberlin.de/openspace), too.

In the two & a half years of its existence, co.up has come a long way. What started out as the office Upstream Agile shared with a few friends has grown into the space we know & love, & was recently incorporated as co.up Coworking Space UG. For the ongoing development of co.up, we are indebted to our awesome community: the many people who cowork with us, organize user groups & events, come by for visits, & with their presence & interest help the space continue to exist & develop. Regular events have provided fertile ground for the community to grow, which is what has made co.up successful thus far, in spite of us not being very focused on the financial aspects of running a space. co.up’s essence has been to evolve naturally with the input, help, & word of mouth of our coworkers & we want to keep it that way. It has been great to have a constant stream of interest from people who have heard about the space from their friends or attended a user group. Letting our coworkers & friends use the space for free to organize community events has always taken priority over creating a strategy to secure more income, which is why we are very grateful to a select group of our coworkers & their companies for helping us renovate & open the new space downstairs. With their support we’re laying ground (literally - the floor is being replaced as I write) for something bigger & better.

The current state of co.up’s finances is pretty steady, which means we cover our costs -- rent, electricity, internet, etc. -- but there is no larger pool of money to draw from to finance everything that we need & want to do for the new space. Right now the conservative estimate of the sum we have to come up with is 7,000€, on top of our current investment of 6,000€. Looking at the pictures of the [rooms downstairs](http://co-up.de/2012/05/09/expansion.html), it’s clear there’s a heap of work to be done. Among other smaller things, like clearing out the unnecessary cables, the big changes include replacing the flooring (already covered), as well as installing sufficient lighting & acoustic panels to reduce the echo. Aside from all this, it ought to go without saying that our coworkers will also require tables & chairs, otherwise productivity is sure to experience a major drop. The giant room will allow us to better accommodate the bigger user groups, but will create the added challenge of finding the best way to provide seating for such a crowd. With the help of designer [Thomas Moll](http://raumfreude.com/) & his connections to good deals on most of the things we need, we hope to create a clean, bright, & inviting space perfect for everything we have in mind. His excellent attention to detail will surely help us achieve the many goals we’ve outlined for the new space.

Still, we can’t reach these goals without your help. The [fundraiser for the new refrigerator](http://co-up.de/2012/01/10/fridge-thanks.html) was a great success that has benefited everyone. With your support, we can go on to do bigger & more wonderful things, like doubling co.up’s size & hopefully also its impact on the tech community of Berlin. We want to be able to continue to provide the space for all of our current user groups, as well as hopefully new ones, educational (& fun!) community events, & volunteer-organized/coached OpenTechSchool workshops. Of course we also want to have a gigantic party on two floors with all of you attending. :)

Let us know you’re coming to the party by donating [here](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/17383) to co.up’s expansion. We're very grateful!
