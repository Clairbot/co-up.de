Thanks to all of you for [pitching in to help us with the new space](http://co-up.de/2012/06/07/crowdfunding-third-floor.html). We are thrilled to know we have you on our side & can't wait to have a party to celebrate that fact. :) Please join us on Friday, June 22nd starting at 20:00 for the first party in the new rooms on the third floor. We will have great DJs, plenty of beer, & a raffle to give away some nice prizes & collect some more donations. You can let us know you're coming via [Plancast](http://plancast.com/p/bsm8/coups-new-space-opening-party) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/events/443917335633625/). Pass on the invitation & bring your friends!

By the way, we will be showing the quarter final on the big screen, so please join us for the game & then continue on to the party.

If you have already visited co.up, you know where to go, but this time ring the bell marked "co.up 3.OG." If you are visiting for the first time, welcome! Directions for finding the space are [here](http://www.co-up.de/about#location).
