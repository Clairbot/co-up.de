On the weekend of August 28th/29th 2010 we will be hosting a local [node.js Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) event.

The knockout is a programming competition where teams build a web software within 48 hours. [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is a new server side JavaScript framework that allows us to build fast and scalable web sites using one of our favorite programming languages.

[Upstream](http://upstre.am) itself will be participating with a team of four. The entire space will be open for other teams and spectators for the most part of the weekend. Coworkers can also come to work.
