It's been another year… & it’s time yet again to raise our prices a bit to reflect inflation, the rising costs of services we provide for you, & to make sure that we can keep giving the space to educational initiatives, user groups, & meetups that create community for free.
As usual, current coworkers will continue paying the amount they do at the moment as long as they don't change their plan.

The new prices are:

Full-time: 210€ monthly

Part-time: 115€ monthly

Basic: 30€ monthly

Day pass: 15€
