Thanks to our many coworkers, friends, drop-ins, user group attendees, & other visitors, it’s been another very full year of coworking. We’re grateful to you! Come celebrate with us on November 24th, starting at 21:00, in the downstairs space. We invite you to enjoy some beer & other non-alcoholic refreshments, as well as great music thanks to our fab DJs from the space opening party. Wear your dancin' shoes & feel free to bring along partners & friends. If you like, you can [RSVP/invite more people on FB](http://www.facebook.com/events/428204670562133/), too.
