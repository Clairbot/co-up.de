Our coworking kitchen has been a messy place. Dishes standing everywhere but in the dishwasher, the dishwasher itself being only half emptied, used coffee mugs all over the place.

One day one of our coworkers, [Jan](http://twitter.com/janl), had enough, and he changed it all with a single piece of paper:

Since then our kitchen has magically become much cleaner. People empty the dish washer and everything.

Inspired by the success, yesterday I tackled the next problem: food becoming alive again and walking around in the fridge.

We'll see how that goes.
