Hi, my name is Michael. I am a [frontend developer](http://justmarkup.com/) from Austria, currently working as a Freelancer in Berlin. At the moment my focus lies on responsive design and thus I am very excited to announce the latest addition to co.up: inspired by <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/5622/">Jeremy Keith</a> and excited by the idea of having test devices just around the corner, we would like to introduce the co.up Open Device Lab.

Since not every developer can afford maintaining a bunch of devices and with the ever-growing need of testing on real devices, we are stoked to get the Device Lab up and running. The idea is to have a collection of donated/loaned devices at the space for our coworkers to use for testing. At the moment we only have a small range of devices, but we're sure that with the help of the community we'll get more soon. If you have any device you would  to share, please write to us at opendevicelab@co-up.de or just drop by the coworking space.

Here is what we have at the moment:

* [Samsung Nexus](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_google_nexus_s-3620.php)
* [Nokia N900](http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/n900/specifications/)
* [iPod touch 2G (iOS 4.2.1)](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP496)

Now that you know about the co.up Open Device Lab,  you surely want to start using it right away. I personally can't wait to get my hands on test devices! If you would like to learn more or have a look, contact us at opendevicelab@co-up.de and we will be happy to get your testing started.
