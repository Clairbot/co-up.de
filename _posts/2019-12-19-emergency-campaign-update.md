Hello co.up community! We have some big news, some good, some bad.

### The good news

This week, we’ve had an outpouring of financial support and as of today we’ve raised over €15.000 (!!!) in one-time payments and €2890 in monthly support! That’s incredible and we couldn’t have done it without the combined effort of everyone in our community. Based on these numbers, we had planned to announce today that we could rest easy and would continue to raise money to finance an expansion of our goals.

### The bad news

This morning, we were informed that our long-term tenant of co.up, who kept our space busy during the daytime and have been highly supportive of our mission, is going to be moving out on March 1st, 2020.

Since we factored this rent into our #saveCoUp calculations, we now have a new problem. Between lost rent, new maintenance, and moving fees, our anticipated costs will rise by roughly €2200/month starting in March. We did some calculations and without their office rent, we’ll go from 96% covered with our current funding level to 56% covered.

Our amended goal is to find a new tenant for the office space. We still consider the campaign a huge success so far. But it does mean we’re going to be working to #saveCoUp a little longer and we need to ask you a huge favor: **If you, or anyone you know, is looking for office space in Berlin, take a look our office!**

We’ve set up a [webpage with more details](/rent-office/).

### Spread the word: Office for rent

We will update this page with more information soon. Please direct anyone interested in renting office space to [this webpage](/rent-office/) and encourage them to reach out to us.

We’re going to keep doing everything we can to keep co.up open. The timing is unfortunate. But we’ve gotten this far based on the co.up community and we’re confident that we’ll be able to find a new tenant for the space.

It’s time for the next stage of #saveCoUp—now let’s get started!
