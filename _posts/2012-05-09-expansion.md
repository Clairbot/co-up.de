All systems are go - the contract for the space two floors down will be signed soon & co.up will double in size.

There still is quite a bit of work to be done, but we hope to have everything ready for coworking in early June.

Since the layout of the space downstairs is bit different, we will now also have more space for the bigger user groups.

Of course this means that we’re looking for more great coworkers to join us, so [drop us a line](http://www.co-up.de/contact) if you or someone you know would make a good fit. :)

By the way we are going to completely overhaul the place – it will look very different from what you see here.
