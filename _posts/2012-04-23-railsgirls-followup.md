Over the weekend, we had the chance to host the RailsGirls followup workshop, which was not only a great learning experience for everyone involved, but also a fun day filled with great energy & yummy cake. :) Read more about it on the [RailsGirls Berlin Tumblr](http://railsgirlsberlin.tumblr.com/post/21599417728/this-is-the-beginning), and watch the short documentary on the April 13-14th event, made by [Alex](http://www.twitter.com/#!/langalex)!
