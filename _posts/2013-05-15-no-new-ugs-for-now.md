co.up’s first & foremost goal has always been to help sustain & foster the growth of the tech community in Berlin, which is why we have always provided the space for free to [events](http://co-up.de/events) that educate & provide networking opportunities to both seasoned professionals & beginners in the tech scene. The events are organized by current & former coworkers, as well as friends of the space; they range from giants, like [BerlinJS](http://berlinjs.org/) & its submeetups, regularly drawing ~100 people or more, sometimes spilling over into the 5th floor with a [Google Hangout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGvZr5EFk7M), to various groups that are still growing, like the recently formed [Freerangers](http://www.meetup.com/Freerangers-Women-Freelancing-In-Tech), an exclusive, biweekly meetup for women & trans* geeks freelancing in tech. We host plenty of one-time events, too, which are not always related to IT but definitely to community & working on a better world, like [Changing Course](http://changingcourseberlin.wordpress.com/). No matter how big or small or what they cover, they are all important as long as they provide worth to the people attending them.

Because our [events calendar](http://bit.ly/CoUpCalendar) has gotten so incredibly full, we have to put a cap on taking on new events for the time being. Requests for hosting one-time events are still welcome! If you can find a free date in the calendar, just send your event proposal to hello\[at\]co-up.de & let us get back to you about whether or not it’s possible.

Thanks to all of our meetup & event organizers for their hard work, making co.up a place for exchange, sharing, & collaboration. We are lucky to have you! &lt;3
