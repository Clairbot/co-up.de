[Campus Party](http://www.campus-party.eu/2012/) is a week-long technology festival taking place annually. It runs 24 hours a day and features over 600 hours of talks, debates, workshops, competitions, & hackathons related to science, innovation, digital entertainment, and creativity. "Recognized as the biggest electronic entertainment event in the world, Campus Party unites the brightest young minds in technology and science under the idea that the “Internet is not a network of computers, it’s a network of people.”

We have been lucky enough to be offered a group of community tickets, which will be given to our coworkers by means of a raffle. All you have to do is click on the banner (or on this [link](http://ads.campus-party.org/www/delivery/ck.php?oaparams=2__bannerid=676__zoneid=384__cb=4f346b7455__oadest=http%3A%2F%2Fcampus-party.eu%2Fwebapp%2Fparticipante%2Fcanal%2F39O18o4oz031xyiiOXOX%3Flang%3DEN), if you can't see it below) & sign up to participate in the drawing. The drawing will end on the 26th of July, so don't put it off! The winners will be announced on the blog/Twitter soon thereafter. Good luck!
