When thinking about who the new space will benefit, we can't possibly forget the [many user groups co.up hosts](http://bit.ly/CoUpCalendar). We are very grateful to the coworkers & friends who take time to organize the events; their involvement & hard work provide opportunities for hundreds of people to listen to interesting talks, learn, be inspired, & find friends with similar interests. It's exciting to think about having double the room for hosting even more user groups & organizations in the new space, but the reality is that we [have not yet reached our goal & need your support](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/17383). Here is a brief rundown of all the user groups that regularly meet in co.up:

[BePHPUG](http://www.bephpug.de/), the PHP user group, meets every first Tuesday of the month & is organized by our good friend & coworker, [Till](https://twitter.com/#!/klimpong). They do a great job of documenting past talks, too: if you missed a meetup, check out their [archive](http://www.bephpug.de/archiv.html).

[Popcorn.js](https://popcorn-berlin.eventbrite.com/) is our newest regular meetup, taking place on the first Wednesday of the month. The event is geared toward Javascript developers, adventuresome filmmakers, & audio hackers interested in exploring media on the web.

[up.front.ug](http://up.front.ug/) is one of our larger user groups, regularly drawing a crowd of a hundred (or sometimes more) people. The talks span a wide range of topics related to front end work & design.  We are especially happy to be able to provide the big room in the new space to accommodate this giant crowd!

[Jan J.](https://twitter.com/#!/JFriedensreich) organizes the [CouchDB User Group](http://berlin.couchdb.org/), which meets every second Wednesday of the month. This user group is especially welcoming to those just getting into CouchDB because they organize an introductory talk for beginners at the beginning of every meetup, starting at 18:30 (pretty awesome!).

Every third Tuesday of the month, the [Magento Stammtisch](http://www.magento-stammtisch.de/) takes place. If you're looking to brush up on your German, this is a great place to do it. :) The speakers' list ir regularly updated [here](https://www.xing.com/events/15-magento-stammtisch-berlin-1103748).

Another big user group is [BerlinJS](http://berlinjs.org), organized by our coworker & UG enthusiast [Robin](https://twitter.com/#!/rmehner). Lots of interesting talks can be heard every third Thursday of the month. Come early to make sure you get a seat & a cold beer!

And last but not least, the [Berlin Mini Game Jam](http://www.berlinminijam.de/) is an especially fun user group slash workshop that takes place once a month on Saturday. This game prototyping workshop is open to everyone, regardless of experience or the materials you'd like to work with to create your game. The exact date can be found either on their blog (see above link) or in the [co.up events calendar](http://bit.ly/CoUpCalendar).

With the creation of [OpenTechSchool](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentechschool), we hope to be able to host a wider variety of user groups - not only for professionals with the specialized interests that come with many years of experience, but also for people new to programming, hacking, & other tech related interests. We hope the community will continue to grow, creating a strong network of people happy to give their time to one another & share their knowledge. Please support our efforts by participating in our [crowdfunding campaign](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/17383/comments/3246) & passing on the word. Heartfelt thanks!
