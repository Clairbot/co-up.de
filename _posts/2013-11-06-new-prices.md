Since it’s been 3 or so years that we’ve been charging the same amount for memberships, it’s finally time to bump the prices up a bit to reflect inflation & other rising costs. We want to continue to be able to provide a community space for all of the user groups that meet here, but also need to stay in the black. Of course current coworkers will continue paying the amount they do so at the moment, provided they don’t change their plan!

The new prices are:

Full-time: 195€ monthly

Part-time: 105€ monthly

Basic: 30€ monthly

Day pass: 15€ (staying the same since we already raised the price last year)
