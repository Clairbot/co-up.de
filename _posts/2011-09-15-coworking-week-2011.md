[Coworking Week 2011](http://www.coworkingweek.de/) (also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/coweek) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/CoworkingWeek)) will take place this year from the 19th until the 25th of September. co.up will be participating by having an open house on Wednesday, the 21st - a day when anyone can come in for a free day of coworking, as well as enjoy some beers with other coworkers when the work day's over at 19:00. We would love to see lots of new faces, especially those of people who are have never worked in a coworking space, so please feel free to extend invitations to anyone you may think would be interested in seeing what our day-to-day is like. People who are unable to attend during the day are welcome to drop by in the evening to have a look around, too.
Please help us get the word out by linking to this blog post or the Facebook [event page](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=234318433282778), [retweeting](http://www.twitter.com/co_up), & by inviting people personally. We look forward to having a full house & a great day to remind us what the best thing about coworking is: community.
