Our fantastic coworker & friend, [Till](http://www.twitter.com/#!/klimpong), along with [Andreas](https://twitter.com/#!/awenkhh) published "[CouchDB: Das Praxisbuch f√ºr Entwickler und Administratoren](http://www.couchdb-buch.de/)." The book is currently only available in German, but anyone looking to translate the material into another language should most definitely [drop the guys a line](http://www.couchdb-buch.de/).
We congratulate Till on the fruits of his hard work & look forward to more publications in the future! :)
