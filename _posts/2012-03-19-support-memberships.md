As you surely know by now, co.up very successfully [crowdfunded](http://co-up.de/2012/01/10/fridge-thanks.html) a refrigerator big enough to cool the hundreds of drinks our user group participants go through each time they come to a meet up. The quick response was amazing & encouraging, especially since we have been spending a fair bit of time trying to figure out how to make co.up sustainable as well as allow for those who want to show their appreciation & support to have a way to do so.

This is why, in addition to our (currently fully booked) full- & part-time plans, we’ll be now offering support memberships. A monthly contribution of 20€ shows us that you love what co.up does & want it to get better. Beyond that, there are a few bonuses, too: a day of coworking, including an hour in the meeting room (to be scheduled & reserved in our Cobot booking calendar) & access to the brand-new member area of [our website](https://members.co-up.de), which will include member profiles, classifieds, job offers, & the space’s newsletter.

The money will be used to improve the space both for our coworkers & guests, as well as the user groups. For example, due to the large volume of attendees, we’ve had several requests to find a way for those who didn’t make it into the main room to be able to listen to & watch talks in the lounge as they take place. Possible solutions to this problem are ceiling-mounted projectors & speakers. Another request was for a way to document user group presentations, which would require a video recording system that would be simple to set up & make transferring material to the net easy, thereby making it possible for whoever couldn’t make it in the evening to benefit from the talks anyway.

We also want to be able to provide more & a wider range of fun & informal community events, like relaxed evenings of beer, movies, games, & other kinds of get-togethers. As always, we’re open to yet other ideas & suggestions that would make the space better for everyone.

Companies will have an opportunity to support the space, too, while receiving different benefits: posting job offers in the member section of the website as well as on an on-site job board in the space, sending employees to cowork with us & meet our coworkers for a chance to form new collaborations, as well as appearing on the website as a sponsor. Please get in touch with us via hello \[at\] co-up.de if you would like for your company to become a supporter of the space.

If you would like to contribute to co.up’s improvement & future as _the_ meeting place for tech-minded people of all kinds, we would be very grateful! You can sign up as an individual support member on our [Cobot site](https://co-up.cobot.me/) (company reps, please contact us).
