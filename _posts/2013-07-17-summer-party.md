It's unbelievable that the summer's already more than half over. Not only that, but August 9th is Coworking Day, too. Let's celebrate by having a barbecue & some cold drinks in the courtyard, starting at 19:00! Please bring along whatever you'd like to throw on the grill, but we'd like to treat you to a few cold beers & non-alcoholic drinks. Friends & loved ones are of course invited to come along with you, so please pass on this invitation. If you'd like to, you can let us know you're coming by RSVPing on the [FB event](https://www.facebook.com/events/563964673641441/). As always, all of the events taking place in the space can be seen on our [events calendar](http://bit.ly/CoUpCalendar). Looking forward to seeing you there. :)
