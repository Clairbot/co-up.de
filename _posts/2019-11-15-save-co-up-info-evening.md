Hello to the co.up community! The Berlin independent tech and creative communities wouldn’t be the same without your passion, creativity, talent, and spirit. You’re the reason that we’re fighting to [#saveCoUp](/support-us)!

As you’ve probably heard, co.up is in a very difficult position. Our rent is going to more than double next year and without a major increase in support, we’ll be forced to **close the space on January 15th, 2020**. But we don’t even really have that long, because we need to see if we can viably earn enough monthly support (roughly 3000€) to stay open. That means that the next month is going to be vital in determining whether or not co.up will exist in 2020.

### Join us on November 19th at 7:30pm
To that end, *we’re hosting a #saveCoUp info evening on November 19th at 7:30pm*, in co.up’s 3rd floor ([Adalbertstraße 8, 10999 Kreuzberg](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//52.5006868,13.4189954/@52.502323,13.418986,15z?hl=en), [Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/562259214586158/)). Come strategize, share your stories, and develop a plan with us to keep co.up open.

We strongly encourage everyone who can make it to attend this event! The more people who can attend and organize with us, the better our shot.
