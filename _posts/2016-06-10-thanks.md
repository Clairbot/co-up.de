We are positively overwhelmed with the fast, generous support we have received since [putting out our call for help to secure the 3rd floor event space](http://co-up.de/2016/06/06/co-up-needs-your-support.html). Heartfelt thanks to all of you who helped us spread the word & saved the day (& the space) for all of us to share! We would especially like to thank the following people & companies who have signed up for support memberships:

The team at co.up is very glad to have a strong community backing us, with the chance to share our resources to help others learn & grow, making the world a bit better bit by bit! <3 We love supporting self-organised learning groups & community initiatives that make tech more inclusive, expecting all of our coworkers, user group participants, & visitors to adhere to our [code of conduct](http://co-up.de/code-of-conduct). We also offer discounted memberships for people in tech affected by sexism, racism, classism, & homo-/transphobia. Get in touch with aleks@co-up.de if you’d like to learn more.

If you would like to sign up for a smaller support membership of 10€ per month that includes a day pass so you can not only support the space but also drop by to cowork with us, [please follow this link](https://members.co-up.de/membership_signup/new?plan_id=ffa4f8bb7f19c0db56c12cd1ed901564).
