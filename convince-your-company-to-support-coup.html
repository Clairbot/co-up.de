  How to Get Your Company to Support co.up
</h1>

<p>
  For co.up to survive, it's going to take recurring support, and while every contribution is essential, our success will depend on getting a few company supporters capable of contributing larger amounts. But how do you get your organization/employer to become a supporter? Here are some steps you can take to start the conversation and turn your company into a co.up supporter.
</p>

<h3>You were hired there, tell them your co.up story!</h3>

<p>
  Nothing beats a personal connection. Open your conversation by speaking about how important co.up was in your history and where you think you'd be without it. Was your first meetup here? Did you make any important connections? Would that have been possible without a free community space like co.up?
</p>
<p>
  Your employer might not know how much co.up is contributing to skills development in its employees—they might not know about co.up at all! If that's the case, give them a brief overview; tell them that it's a community space that offers free event space for public organizations working to make tech more representative in Berlin.
</p>

<h3>You get benefits, too!</h3>

<p>
  co.up is filling knowledge gaps. Your company's employees get access to free knowledge-sharing which can range anywhere from talks at meetups to workshops and co-learning; these all help them to become better, well-rounded and knowledgeable employees. Most of these events are made possible by the access co.up provides to free and regularly available event space.
</p>
<p>
  Do you currently go to a meetup, learning group, or other event in co.up? If so, your company is already benefiting from co.up! Emphasize what you've gotten out of your experience in the space and how it's been developing your skills and networks, and how the company will lose that resource in your life and others' if co.up doesn't get company support. The monthly cost for your company is probably less than paying for your professional development outside of co.up!
</p>

<h3>What co.up offers</h3>

<p>
  Your company's logo will be prominently placed on our website and in the space, both of which are regularly seen by tech workers and talent in Berlin.
</p>

<p>
  You'll receive a shot out on our social media, as well as a mention in our blog.
</p>

<p>
  If your company commits to a recurring membership of more than EUR 300, or a one-time contribution of EUR 1500 at once, in addition to the other benefits, you'll get the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your company will get access to our event space for private events at a 25% discount, which they can use for company off-sites, events, or other closed functions.</li>
  <li>A dedicated post on our blog about your company (text provided by you)</li>
  <li>We're also working on a way to match recruiters with interested applicants at events in the space that should be premiered early next year.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Support the tech environment that supports you</h3>

<p>
  Supporting co.up means supporting an organization that makes the Berlin tech scene extremely valuable for prospective employees from outside of Berlin. In a competitive job market, saying that you support the local tech scene is a great pitch for why a prospective employee should decide to work for you.
</p>

<p>
  Here are just a few of the events that operate in the space (you'll find a full list here: <a href="/events">https://co-up.de/events/</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>berlin.JS</li>
  <li>OpenTechSchool</li>
  <li>bePHPug</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Supporting the community reassures people that your company cares about the tech community and the personal career development of its employees.

<h3>What to do if they say no?</h3>

<p>
  Don’t panic! You might hear a few different things:
</p>

<div class="question-response">
  <p class="b">“We only support non-profits.”</p>
  <p>
    "We only support non-profits."
    <br>
    What to say: "Think about it as paying for my professional development." It's difficult to get around this one—there might be company policy that prevents it as a whole. However, if your company pays for remote workers' coworking space memberships, professional development, or other employee perks, try and emphasize the functionality of co.up to you and others. It's a bargain at that price!

      <b>”Why don’t we get more for supporting them?”</b>
      <br>
      What to say: "You get so much!" Besides the discount on space rental, and the reach from co.up's website and social media, think about the amount of talent that passes through co.up's doors every month (roughly 500 people). Attracting talent is getting more difficult by the day—here's an affordable way to give yourself an edge in recruitment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>"We can't make a recurring contribution because of our accounting situation. Is there still a way to help?"</b>
      <br>
      What to say: "Yes!" We've set up an option for companies who have difficulties making recurring payments for accounting purposes, you can find one that suits your company here: <a href="https://members.co-up.de/">https://members.co-up.de/</a>
