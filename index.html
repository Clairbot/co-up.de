  <p>
    In light of the current covid-19 pandemic, we have decided to <strong>close the space to all events until further notice</strong>. We will set a reopening date once federal and local authorities and health experts have given the all-clear to hold events, and will communicate this date once it has been decided. This also applies to events taking place in the Cobot offices, formerly known as our 5th floor.
