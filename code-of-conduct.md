  Code of Conduct
</h1>

### Purpose

The primary goal of co.up is to help the people here grow to their full potential, so that they may live a more fulfilling life and contribute to the lives of those around them.

We aim to create an inclusive space‭ ‬with‭ community members of ‬the‭ ‬most‭ ‬varied‭ ‬and‭ ‬diverse‭ ‬backgrounds‭ ‬possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of race, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religious beliefs and physical appearance.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for everyone who uses the space, whether as a coworker or as an organiser or attendee of meetups and other events taking place here. The code of conduct applies not only in our space, but also online networks, at all related events, and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. It also states the consequences of violating these expectations.

We invite co.up’s coworkers, community leaders, event organisers, supporters, and visitors to help us create a safer space and positive experiences for everyone.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist. Positive action, pushing back against discrimination, and reflecting on the harmful messages we have all internalised are essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

### Expected Behavior

Participate in an authentic and proactive way, helping take care of the space. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community resource.
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration and negotiation before conflict.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
Apologise sincerely when you hurt someone. Recognise the effects of your actions are more important than your intent.
Intervene directly (or find someone to help) when witnessing abusive behaviour of any degree.
Alert the co.up staff, event organisers or community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.

### Boundaries

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our space, online networks, and in all related events and communications.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religious beliefs, or physical appearance; inappropriate use of nudity or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; non-consensual photography or recording; sustained disruption of work or events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

### Consequences of Violations

Unacceptable behavior from any member, including event organisers and staff, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to cease a violating behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

We may additionally decide to take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary or permanent ban from co.up without warning and without refund of prepaid fees.

### Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, harassment, or have any other concerns, please notify a staff member, event organizer, or other community member as soon as possible.

If you witness unacceptable behaviour, intervene immediately by addressing both parties directly, to tell the first person their behaviour is inappropriate, and to ask the second person what they would need to feel safer or would like to have done about the situation, as well as notifying a staff member or event organiser. Definitionsmacht or definitory power (the right of the person being harassed to define what constitutes harassment as well as to contribute in outlining the consequences for said behaviour) applies here.

### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify staff or an event organiser with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governance policies.
